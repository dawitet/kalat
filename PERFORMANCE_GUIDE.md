# Performance and Code Structure Best Practices

This document provides guidelines for maintaining high performance and clean code structure in the Kalat word game app.

## Animation Performance

### Use `useNativeDriver` where possible

Native-driven animations run on the UI thread and don't require JavaScript to execute each frame, resulting in smoother animations:

```tsx
// Good practice
withTiming(1, { 
  duration: 300,
  easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease),
  useNativeDriver: true 
})
```

### Memoize animated styles

Use `useAnimatedMemo` or memoize values to prevent unnecessary style recalculations:

```tsx
// Import our custom hook
import { useAnimatedMemo } from '../hooks/useAnimatedMemo';

// Use it to memoize animated styles
const animatedStyle = useAnimatedMemo(() => {
  return {
    opacity: opacity.value,
    transform: [{ scale: scale.value }]
  };
}, []);
```

### Batch animations for related UI elements

When animating multiple elements that logically belong together, coordinate their animations from a parent component.

## Component Reusability

### Use composition over inheritance

Break UI into small, reusable components and compose them together:

```tsx
// Instead of many specific buttons:
<PrimaryButton />
<SecondaryButton />
<OutlineButton />

// Use a single component with variants:
<Button variant="primary" />
<Button variant="secondary" />
<Button variant="outline" />
```

### Implement compound components for complex UIs

For related components that share state, use the compound component pattern:

```tsx
<Modal>
  <Modal.Header>Title</Modal.Header>
  <Modal.Body>Content</Modal.Body>
  <Modal.Footer>
    <Button>Close</Button>
  </Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
```

## State Management

### Use action creators for type safety

```tsx
// Define action creators
const setActiveModal = (modal: ModalType) => ({
  type: 'SET_ACTIVE_MODAL' as const,
  payload: modal
});

// Use in components
dispatch(setActiveModal('settings'));
```

### Separate UI state from game logic

Keep game logic separate from UI state to make the reducer more maintainable:

```tsx
// Game logic state
const gameReducer = (state, action) => {...};

// UI state
const uiReducer = (state, action) => {...};

// Combine them
const rootReducer = (state, action) => ({
  game: gameReducer(state.game, action),
  ui: uiReducer(state.ui, action)
});
```

## React Optimization Techniques

### Use `React.memo` for components that render often but change rarely

```tsx
const Tile = (props) => {
  // component logic
};

export default React.memo(Tile);
```

### Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to children

```tsx
const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
  // handle press logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations

```tsx
const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {
  return items.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
}, [items]);
```

## Testing Strategies

### Component Tests

Test components in isolation with react-testing-library:

```tsx
test('Button responds to press', () => {
  const onPress = jest.fn();
  const { getByText } = render(<Button onPress={onPress}>Press Me</Button>);
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Press Me'));
  expect(onPress).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Reducer Tests

Test reducer functions directly:

```tsx
test('handles ADD_LETTER action', () => {
  const initialState = { currentGuess: 'he' };
  const action = { type: 'ADD_LETTER', payload: 'l' };
  const newState = reducer(initialState, action);
  expect(newState.currentGuess).toBe('hel');
});
```

### Mock Animations in Tests

When testing components with animations, mock the animation libraries:

```tsx
jest.mock('react-native-reanimated', () => require('react-native-reanimated/mock'));
```

## Best Practices Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Animation System | âœ… Complete | Enhanced with specialized hooks |
| Component Reusability | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Button and Modal components created |
| State Management | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Action creators and types defined |
| Testing Setup | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Basic test structure created |
| Performance Optimization | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Memoization patterns implemented |

## Next Steps

1. **Component Library Completion**
   - Implement Form inputs (TextInput, Checkbox, etc.)
   - Create consistent layout components

2. **State Management Refinement**
   - Separate UI and game logic reducers
   - Add persistence layer with proper typing

3. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Add end-to-end tests for main game flow
   - Add snapshot tests for UI components

4. **Animation Performance Analysis**
   - Profile app performance during animations
   - Optimize any jank or dropped frames
