// --- Backend API ---
// Define the base path for your API calls. Adjust if your worker has a custom domain.
// Using a relative path assumes the frontend and backend are served from the same origin
// or that a proxy handles routing. If they are on different domains, use the full worker URL.

// --- Cloud Storage Keys REMOVED ---
